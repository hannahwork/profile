                <p id="about-me-text">I am a twenty-ssshh year old learning how to code. My journey started officially in July 2024 when I left my teaching career 
                to do a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. Since then I've been able to career switch into a full time Software Developer role.
                Outside of tech, I am a big ol' bookworm and dog lover. My current favourite book is called <strong><em>The five people you meet in Heaven</em></strong> 
                and my current favourite dog is called <strong><em>Zeus</em></strong>, although I doubt that's ever going to change.</p>

                    <p>Besides dogs and books, a really big passion of mine is <strong>travelling</strong>. In 2024 I was fortunate
                    enough to visit the below countries, and in 2025 I hope to visit many more countries. You can keep up with my travels on a travel tiktok I started
                    very recently: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@haychabroad" target="_blank"> Haych Abroad</a>!</p>

                    <h3 id="topic-title">Fitness</h3>
                    <p>I've always considered myself a fitness girly, and as I entered adult life, I became fascinated with gut health and physical activity. Some of the things I 
                    do now to keep fit and healthy include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Going to the gym 5x a week, Mon-Fri</li>
                        <li>Two daily walks with my dog morning and evening</li>
                        <li><em>Trying</em> my best to eat clean</li>
                        <li>An early bedtime</li>
                        <li>Keeping hydrated, although I need notifications and reminders for this</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="topic-title">Reading</h3>
                    <p>Like I said initally, I'm a big ol' bookworm. Books about the interconnectedness of humans are the books
                    I enjoy most. I think my top 5 favourite books that I've read this year are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Anxious People</li>
                        <li>The five people you meet in Heaven</li>
                        <li>Yellow Face</li>
                        <li>Girl, Woman, Other</li>
                        <li>All About Love</li>
                    </ol>
