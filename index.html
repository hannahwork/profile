        <h1>Hannah's Coding journey so far:</h1>
        <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>I am a twenty-ssshh year old learning how to code. My coding journey started officially in July 2024 when I left my teaching career 
            to take part in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. Since then I've been able to career switch into a full time Software Developer role.
            Outside of tech, I am a big ol' bookworm and dog lover. My current favourite book is called <strong><em>The five people you meet in Heaven</em></strong> 
            and my current favourite dog is called <strong><em>Zeus</em></strong>, although I doubt that's ever going to change.</p>
