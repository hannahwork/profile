                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <div>
                    <img src="" alt=""/>
                    <p>I am a twenty-ssshh year old learning how to code. My coding journey started officially in July 2024 when I left my teaching career 
                    to take part in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. Since then I've been able to career switch into a full time Software Developer role.
                    Outside of tech, I am a big ol' bookworm and dog lover. My current favourite book is called <strong><em>The five people you meet in Heaven</em></strong> 
                    and my current favourite dog is called <strong><em>Zeus</em></strong>, although I doubt that's ever going to change.</p>

                <p>Besides dogs and books, a really big passion of mine is <strong>travelling</strong>. In 2024 I was fortunate
                enough to visit these countries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tanzania</li>

                    <li>Jamaica</li>
                    <li>Bahamas</li>
                    <li>USA: Los Angeles, Miami and New York</li>
                    <li>Albania</li>
                    <li>Mexico</li>
                </ul>
                <p>and in 2025 I hope to visit many more countries. You can keep up with my travels on a travel tiktok I started
                very recently: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@haychabroad" target="_blank"> Haych Abroad</a> </p>

                <h3>Fitness</h3>
                <p>
                I've always considered myself a fitness girly, Growing up I was enrolled in Ballet, Gymnastics, and Karate classes but never took them too seriously. 
                As I entered adult life, fitness became extremely important to me and I became fascinated with gut health and physical activity. Some of the things I 
                do now to keep fit and healthy include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Gym 5x a week, Mon-Fri</li>
                <li>Two daily walks with my dog morning and evening - this is mainly for him but its great to get outside</li>
                <li>Try my best at clean eating, you'll often catch me doing "30 days no sugar challenges"</li>
                <li>An early bedtime - this has actually been a little harder to do lately.</li>
                <li>Keeping hydrated, although I have to actually have notifications rmeminding me to drink more water</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>
                Like I said initally, I'm a big ol' bookworm. I love reading from a range of fiction and non-fiction genres (not
                so much horror) but I think theres a special place in my heart for Psychological/Philosophical and Romance
                Fiction. Books that touch on the interconnectedness of humans and the relationships we build often are the books
                I enjoy most. I think my top 5 favourite books that I've read this year are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li>Anxious People</li>
                <li>The five people you meet in Heaven</li>
                <li>Yellow Face</li>
                <li>Girl, Woman, Other</li>
                <li>All About Love</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
